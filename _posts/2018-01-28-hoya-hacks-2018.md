At Hoya Hacks 2018, I worked with a group of three in developing a therapy chat bot. It was a fun experience and I learned a lot! I learned new frameworks like Ionic, explored new languages like React.js, and even got to play with some cool hardware like the Google Cardboard. It was an enjoyable experience, and although we didn't win, I think we did a pretty good job as we were able to deploy an actual product in the end. I look forward to Hoya Hacks 2019!
