At the Biobytes Hackathon hosted at the University of Maryland, I worked in a team of two in developing a Facebook messenger chat bot. It was definitely an enjoyable experience, especially learning how simple it was to use the Facebook API. The goal of the hackathon was to tackle either a physical or mental disability issue, and we decided to try to tackle social anxiety. I talked to mentors and professionals in their respective fields at the hackathon, an interesting networking opportunity for sure. In the end, my team placed 3rd with our messenger bot!
