Hi, welcome to my page! My name is Allen Liu and I am a Junior double majoring in Computer Science and Mathematics at the University of Maryland, College Park. I have previously interned at
[BAE Systems, Inc](https://www.baesystems.com/en/home). I have a wide variety of technical interests, including web development, mobile app development, and overall frontend/backend app development. This is shown more in depth through my Github link listed in the bottom.

Outside of technical interests, I am interested in music, writing, and basketball. Links to work related to these interests are found under the "Hobbies" tab.

I am also involved in numerous extracurriculars in school. I serve as a [America Counts mentor](http://thestamp.umd.edu/leadership_community_service-learning/programs/america_reads_america_counts), and have volunteered in several events within cultural organizations such as the
[Vietnamese Student Association](http://www.vsaumcp.com/) and the [Chinese Student Association](http://www.vsaumcp.com/). Feel free to contact me with via email listed below.
